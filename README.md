# ATM_Mini_Simulation
The "ATM Mini Simulation" project is a compact yet comprehensive implementation that replicates the operations of an Automated Teller Machine (ATM). 
The project serves as a simplified demonstration of how an ATM system functions, enabling users to interact with their bank accounts through a command-line interface. With a focus on user authentication, account management, and transaction processing, the simulation project offers a glimpse into the mechanics of real-world financial systems.

Key Features
Login System: Users are required to enter their account number and Personal Identification Number (PIN) to access their accounts securely. The project employs a validation mechanism to ensure the authenticity of the provided credentials.

Account Operations: Once logged in, users can perform various account operations:

Deposit: Users can deposit funds into their accounts.
Withdraw: Funds can be withdrawn, provided there is a sufficient balance.
Check Balance: Users can view their account balance.
Change PIN: A secure way to modify their account PIN for enhanced security.
Logout: Users can log out to terminate their session.
Account Creation: The project also offers the capability to create new bank accounts. Users can input their name and a 4-digit PIN to establish their account. The system ensures that the PIN meets the required length.

Learning Outcomes
By developing the "ATM Mini Simulation" project, the author gained hands-on experience in various fundamental programming concepts and techniques:

Structures: The project effectively utilizes C structures to organize and manage account-related information, such as account number, name, PIN, and balance.

Input and Output Handling: Input from users, such as PINs and transaction amounts, is processed using scanf, while output messages are displayed to users using printf.

Conditional Statements: The project demonstrates the usage of conditional statements (if, else) to control program flow and ensure secure transactions.

Loops: The project employs a perpetual loop to maintain the main program menu, providing users with the option to perform multiple actions without exiting the program.

String Handling: String functions such as strcmp and strcpy are used to compare PINs and update PIN values securely.

Function Modularization: The code is divided into separate functions, promoting code reusability, readability, and ease of maintenance.

Conclusion
The "ATM Mini Simulation" project is an excellent illustration of the author's foundational programming skills and their ability to translate theoretical concepts into practical applications. Through its emphasis on user authentication, account management, and transaction handling, this project serves as a valuable educational tool for understanding the core mechanisms of an ATM system.
